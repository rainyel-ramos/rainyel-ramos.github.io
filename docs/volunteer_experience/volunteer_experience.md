At the University of Havana, the student who has finished a course can help the professors to teach that course, this depends on the difficulty of the course. Sometimes the student can help new students to the course by giving them practical exercises, but, if the course is taught in another faculty, the student can teach the entire course with the supervision of a professor. I taught the Informatics course at FFH (Facultad de Filosofia e Historia, School of Philosophy and History of Havana University) in the Sociology career. Topics were on creating articles in Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft Excel, bibliography management in EndNote and SPSS Statistics. The course was designed to teach sociology students the necessary tools for creating articles, managing statistics, creating videos, presentations, some notions of cybersecurity, searching the web, compressing digital files, and others. Sociologists use these tools and knowledge for their research.

- Designed and reviewed the tests given to the students.
- Designed and taught the informatic course for the degree in sociology, I focused on the simple explanation of the topics because sociologists do not have a strong informatic background.
- Informed teachers about the academic development of each student in the course to give a differentiated educational treatment to those students with low performance.
- Attended meetings with the dean and vice dean of the School of Philosophy and History of Havana University and coordinated the date and time of exams and conferences.

**Main topics**:

- Microsoft Word:

    - Bibliography management using EndNote.
    - Modification of the color and size of the font for a better appearance of the document.
    - Headers and footer creation.
    - Creation of page breaks to get a specific content to be on a new page helping to have a better document format.
    - Bibliography management using Microsoft Word tools to help automatically cite and format the bibliography.
    - Generation of the table of content to have better access to the topics of the document.
    - PDF generation from the Word document.

- SPSS Statistics:

    - Creation, export and import of datasets to save them.
    - Automatic generation of pie charts, histograms, bar charts, etc. from data sets to gain a better understanding of information through visualization.
    - Filtering datasets to search for specific data.
    - Calculation of mean, median and statistical frequencies.
