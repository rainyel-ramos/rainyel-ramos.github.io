*June, 2022 â€“ July, 2022*

Havana, Cuba

This project is related to increase the system functionalities of Falabella Bank in Chile. The basic idea of this project was to create a SaaS platform that could be used by Falabella employees. My work was about to create the functionalities to transform some digital documents into others using filtering and merging of that documents. The architecture of the system was already created. I had not many experience about how to implement the tasks requested but thanks to my excellent education in Havana University and my quick learner skills I was able to learn about AWS Lambda functions, AWS Step Functions, Serverless Framework and others AWS and cloud technologies implementing all the necessary tasks.

- Splited the serverless code (serverless framework and cloud formation code) in multiple files to improve code organization, readability and quality.
- Used AWS SSM to read and store parameter to guarantee parameters passing between AWS Stacks.
- Used the branching model of git flow to get a better organization in the project development.
- Used Python GQL library to query AWS Appsync services obtaining multiple JSON documents.
