<!-- Elasbit is a Chilean company that had the idea to create a NFT collection and some games based in this collection. The basic idea was to sell the NFTs to users and give special rewards in the games to the NFTs owners. The client already had the solution to mint the NFTs using Metaplex but he had not the necessary smart contracts for the games. Using my experience in Rust, smart contracts and blockchain I was capable to quickly learn about Solana blockchain and create the smart contract for the games. I reviewed dozens of smart contracts deployed in Solana and this help me to learn about common architectural patterns, this patterns was applied to the implemented smart contract improving performance, readability, code quality, genericity, user trust and security. -->

### Hard / Technical achievements

- Analyzed more than 10k lines of code (undocumented) in Python to created a base architecture diagram of the system. This help to newcomers teammates to understand the microservices of the system, the interactions between them and the information flow between them.
- Migrated more than 5k of lines of code (undocumented) in Python to Velocity Template Language (VTL) in AWS Appsync.
- Transformed AWS Lambdas code in AWS Appsync pipelines, migrating the code logic from lambdas to appsync endpoints. This help to delete the lambdas cold start and reduce the response time from 6-5 seconds to 3-2 seconds.
- Researched about the possibility of use SQL Functions and Procedures to implement the AWS Lambdas functionalities in the AWS Aurora MySql database. The idea of this research was to migrate the lambdas code to SQL and reduce the system's response time.
- Integrated AWS Appsync with AWS Aurora RDS MySql database using VTL.
- Participated in pair programming sessions with teammates to fix bug or reviewing code, improving code quality and readability.
- Open hotfixes to directly patch bugs in production code (on Fridays :grin:).
- Used AWS SSM to read and store parameter to guarantee parameters passing between AWS Stacks.
- Used the branching model of git flow to get a better organization in the project development.
- Extended the system capabilities adding new Python classes to a class hierarchy following Object Oriented Programming best practices and helping to encapsulate, extend and reutilize the new code in the future.
- Periodically monitored AWS SQS queues to alert about possible issues in the system helping to solve errors before users reported them.
- Tested VTL AWS Appsync templates using AWS SDK to guarantee the correctness of the solution and to improve code quality and readability.
- Reported found bugs to front end developers to be fixed before users reported them.
- Received issues found by others team members to be fixed for me before users reported them.
- Used Postman to make queries to AWS Appsync endpoints.

### Soft achievements

- Attended to daily meetings with the team to coordinate tasks and find potentials problems in the development of the solution.
- Used Jira to organize and track the assignee tasks.
- Followed the scrum methodology guaranteeing an agile development process.
- Asked for help to others more experienced developers to solve difficult issues in my implementation/code.
- Asked the details about the system architecture/information flow/microservices integration to others more experienced developers to have a better understanding of the system.
- Exposed in the daily meetings the progress of my tasks, helping to others to understand my progress and the implementation of my tasks.
- Proposed the use of SQL Functions and Procedures to implement some backend functionalities to help to reduce the system's response time.
- Tested the new system capabilities with Scrum Master and Product Owner.
- Received questions and help request from others developers and helped to fix their issues making suggestions about how to test/implement a specific functionality.
