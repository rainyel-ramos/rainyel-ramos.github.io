<!-- small description about the client and its requirements or problems, how I solve it -->

- Attended to daily meetings with the team to coordinate tasks and potentials problems in the develompent of the solution.
- Proposed the use of cryptography techniques (e.g. password salting) to store the user data on the contract improving security.
- Designed, implemented and deployed the smart contract.
- Designed and implemented a state machine for the smart contract to guarantee a correct information flow improving security.
- Implemented a simple technique to serialize floating point numbers in Anchor, helping to add new functionalities to the smart contract.
- Tested the smart contract to guarantee the correctness of the solution.
- Participated in pair programming sessions with teammates to fix bug or reviewing code, improving code quality and readability.
- Attended to meetings with the Product Manager to propose or define the features (improvement to features) of the smart contract.
<!-- - Fixed aws step functions code, improve readability of this -->

## **Blockchain developer**

[AgTrace][13179854458968804319] ([Web page][12149870873725910779])

AgTrace is a Brazilian startup that proposes a blockchain traceability solution to track all stages of the food chain. The client already had a Crodapp (Corda smart contracts definition) implemented, but he had not the necessary permissioned network to get the cordapp up and running. Because Corda is a permissioned blockchain the idea was to create a network to deploy the cordapp. Using my previous experience with permissioned blockchains (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric) I was capable to implement a Corda network with all the necessary components to deploy the client solution.
<!-- small description about the client and its requirements or problems, how I solve it -->

- Proposed, and analyzed with the client, multiples blockchain architectures to deploy the client solution.
- Created a decentralized Corda network using AWS EC2 instances and Docker.
- Deploy the Corda nodes in Docker containers inside AWS EC2 instances.
- Fixed, modified and improved Corda open source tools to create the necessary crypto artifacts used for the network (e.g. [Network parameter signer][11758297596384249371]).
- Deployed the client Crodapp to the created network.
- Tested the Cordapp endpoints to guarantee the correctness of the solution.
- Created, and reviewed with the client, examples about the tokenization in permissioned blockchain networks using an information flow based in Hyperledger Fabric.

Stack:
: Corda, Kotlin, Java, AWS EC2, AWS, Docker, Docker-compose, Thunder, Api Rest.

*keywords*:
: Blockchain, Cryptography, Public Key Infrastructure, Cryptographic Certificates, Asymmetric Cryptography, X509 Certificates.
