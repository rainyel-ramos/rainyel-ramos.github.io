Elasbit is a Chilean company that had the idea to create a NFT collection and some games based in this collection. The basic idea was to sell the NFTs to users and give special rewards in the games to the NFTs owners. The client already had the solution to mint the NFTs using Metaplex but he had not the necessary smart contracts for the games. Using my experience in Rust, smart contracts and blockchain I was capable to quickly learn about Solana blockchain and create the smart contract for the games. I reviewed dozens of smart contracts deployed in Solana and this help me to learn about common architectural patterns, this patterns was applied to the implemented smart contract improving performance, readability, code quality, genericity, user trust and security.
<!-- small description about the client and its requirements or problems, how I solve it -->

- Attended to daily meetings with the team to coordinate tasks and find potentials problems in the development of the solution.
- Proposed the use of cryptographic techniques (e.g. password salting) to store the user data on the smart contract improving security.
- Designed, in coordination with the Product Manager, the smart contract.
- Implemented and deployed the smart contract.
- Designed and implemented a state machine for the smart contract to guarantee a correct information flow improving security.
- Implemented a technique to serialize floating point numbers in Anchor, helping to add new functionalities to the smart contract.
- Tested the smart contract to guarantee the correctness of the solution.
- Participated in pair programming sessions with teammates to fix bug or reviewing code, improving code quality and readability.
- Attended to meetings with the Product Manager to propose or define the features (improvement to features) of the smart contract.
- Implemented an AWS Lambda function to query the blockchain to know the different status of the sent transactions.
- Used AWS Lambda functions to implement the backend functionalities.
- Designed, implemented and tested the frontend state machines using XState, guaranteeing a correct information flow in the frontend, improving code quality and readability, improving security and helping to separate the frontend logic from the components.
- Helped to design the frontend state machines to get a visual representation of the frontend information flow.
- Used the pattern of actor model in the state machines of the frontend improving code quality.
- Researched about Solend (lending/borrow platform in Solana) and Jupiter (swap aggregator platform in Solana) and how to use its APIs.
- Fixed AWS Step Functions using Serverless Framework.
- Used the branching model of git flow to get a better organization in the project development.
- Proposed a trustless architecture for the smart contract using economics incentives, helping to delete the user trust on the backend.
- Helped to integrate frontend and backend services using subscription pattern.
- Integrated the backend with the smart contract.

## **Blockchain developer**

[AgTrace][13179854458968804319] ([Web page][12149870873725910779])

*October, 2021 – November, 2021*

Havana, Cuba

AgTrace is a Brazilian startup that proposes a blockchain traceability solution to track all stages of the food chain. The client already had a Crodapp (Corda smart contracts definition) implemented, but he had not the necessary permissioned network to get the cordapp up and running. Because Corda is a permissioned blockchain the idea was to create a network to deploy the cordapp. Using my previous experience with permissioned blockchains (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric) I was capable to implement a Corda network with all the necessary components to deploy the client solution.
<!-- small description about the client and its requirements or problems, how I solve it -->
<!-- split the section between hard (technical achievements) and soft archievements. -->
- Proposed, and analyzed with the client, multiples blockchain architectures to deploy the client solution.
- Created a decentralized Corda network using AWS EC2 instances and Docker.
- Deploy the Corda nodes in Docker containers inside AWS EC2 instances.
- Fixed, modified and improved Corda open source tools to create the necessary crypto artifacts used for the network (e.g. [Network parameter signer][11758297596384249371]).
- Deployed the client Cordapp to the created network.
- Tested the Cordapp endpoints to guarantee the correctness of the solution.
- Created, and reviewed with the client, examples about the tokenization in permissioned blockchain networks using an information flow based in Hyperledger Fabric.
<!-- add that was established a constant communication between the client and me, i continuosly propose new features and improvements to my proposed solution and to the client solution -->
