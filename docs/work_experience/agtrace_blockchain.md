AgTrace is a Brazilian startup that proposes a blockchain traceability solution to track all stages of the food chain. The client already had a Crodapp (Corda smart contracts definition) implemented, but he had not the necessary permissioned network to get the cordapp up and running. Because Corda is a permissioned blockchain the idea was to create a network to deploy the cordapp. Using my previous experience with permissioned blockchains (e.g. Hyperledger Fabric) I was capable to implement a Corda network with all the necessary components to deploy the client solution.
<!-- small description about the client and its requirements or problems, how I solve it -->
<!-- split the section between hard (technical achievements) and soft archievements. -->
- Proposed, and analyzed with the client, multiples blockchain architectures to deploy the client solution.
- Created a decentralized Corda network using AWS EC2 instances and Docker.
- Deploy the Corda nodes in Docker containers inside AWS EC2 instances.
- Fixed, modified and improved Corda open source tools to create the necessary crypto artifacts used for the network (e.g. [Network parameter signer][11758297596384249371]).
- Deployed the client Cordapp to the created network.
- Tested the Cordapp endpoints to guarantee the correctness of the solution.
- Created, and reviewed with the client, examples about the tokenization in permissioned blockchain networks using an information flow based in Hyperledger Fabric.
<!-- add that was established a constant communication between the client and me, i continuosly propose new features and improvements to my proposed solution and to the client solution -->
