## [**RainyelLedger**][36]

*April 2021 - present*

Modified the substrate node template to get a permissioned blockchain node to create a permissioned blockchain.

- Created a Docker image for Substrate node template with only 3 GB, half of Docker image used by Substrate.
- Added and configured contract pallet to the node to execute smart contracts using ink!.
- Added and configured node authorization pallet to give access to the network to specific nodes creating a permissioned network.
- Implemented RPC calls to contracts adding the functionality of query the contract storage.
- Added and configured a custom pallet that use the sudo pallet and the contract pallet to give access to sudo origin for contract instantiation.

Stack:
: Rust, Substrate, ink!, Docker

*keywords*:
: Blockchain, Cryptography, Distributed Systems, Smart Contracts.

## **Blockchain system for medical records storage.**

*Undergraduate thesis project*

*March 2020 - August 2020*

Cuban health care system work with physical health records, some efforts for digitalize health records has been realized but using centralized databases. In this project is implemented a functional prototype for electronic health record storage using Hyerledger Fabric.
<!-- // todo explain how it work -->

- Designed and implemented a Hyperledger Fabric network.
- Designed digital medical records using the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) standard as assets to be saved on a blockchain.
- Designed and implemented a smart contract (chaincode) to save, list and modify digital medical records on a Hyperledger Fabric network.
- Designed and implemented a web server to communicate with the blockchain network.
- Designed and implemented a web application to interact with the blockchain network.

<!--explain better, add more specific tasks, create a wrapper for fabric sdk for example-->

Stack:
: Node.js, Hyperledger Fabric, Adminbro, Docker, Docker Compose, Convector, TypeScript, Hurley, Express.js.
