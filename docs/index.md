## Summary
I am a young computer scientist graduate in Havana University, Cuba. I graduated in November, 2020. Passionate about machine learning, blockchain technology, distributed systems and cryptography, I have read some interesting books: Distributed Systems written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Decentralized Applications written by Siraj Raval, Architecture for Blockchain Applications written by Xiwei Xu, Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques written by Ian H. Witten, and many papers in www.researchgate.net. My interest in distributed systems started when I implemented Chord DHT in a project, I was fascinated with the auto estabilize property of this data structure. I am a hard-working, inquisitive, creative and enthusiastic computer scientist with a strong theoretical background in distributed systems, machine learning, blockchain technology, programming and math. Skilled in collaboration, adaptability and communication. Experience of 1 year in blockchain and more than 4 years of experience in software development. I like to learn new languages and technologies related with machine learning, blockchain, distributed systems and cryptography.

## ‚ù§Ô∏è Volunteer experience

**Informatics assistant professor**

[Havana University][13]

*September, 2019 - January, 2020*

Charitable cause: Education

At the University of Havana, the student who has finished a course can help the professors to teach that course, this depends on the difficulty of the course. Sometimes the student can help new students to the course by giving them practical exercises, but, if the course is taught in another faculty, the student can teach the entire course with the supervision of a professor. I taught the Informatics course at FFH (Facultad de Filosofia e Historia, School of Philosophy and History of Havana University) in the Sociology career. Topics were on creating articles in Microsoft Word, Microsoft PowerPoint presentations, Microsoft Excel, bibliography management in EndNote and SPSS Statistics. The course was designed to teach sociology students the necessary tools for creating articles, managing statistics, creating videos, presentations, some notions of cybersecurity, searching the web, compressing digital files, and others. Sociologists use these tools and knowledge for their research.

- Designed and reviewed the tests given to the students.
- Designed and taught the informatic course for the degree in sociology, I focused on the simple explanation of the topics because sociologists do not have a strong informatic background.
- Informed teachers about the academic development of each student in the course to give a differentiated educational treatment to those students with low performance.
- Attended meetings with the dean and vice dean of the School of Philosophy and History of Havana University and coordinated the date and time of exams and conferences.

**Main topics**:

- Microsoft Word:

    - Bibliography management using EndNote.
    - Modification of the color and size of the font for a better appearance of the document.
    - Headers and footer creation.
    - Creation of page breaks to get a specific content to be on a new page helping to have a better document format.
    - Bibliography management using Microsoft Word tools to help automatically cite and format the bibliography.
    - Generation of the table of content to have better access to the topics of the document.
    - PDF generation from the Word document.

- SPSS Statistics:

    - Creation, export and import of datasets to save them.
    - Automatic generation of pie charts, histograms, bar charts, etc. from data sets to gain a better understanding of information through visualization.
    - Filtering datasets to search for specific data.
    - Calculation of mean, median and statistical frequencies.

- Analyzed some blockchain platforms and technologies such as: Bitcoin, Ethereum, HashGraph, Hyperledger Fabric, BigChain, Corda, Quorum.
- Deeply analyzed the Hyperledger Fabric architecture.
- Explained the differences between private, permissioned and public blockchains.
- Different applications of blockchains were analyzed such as: blockchain in games, blockchain in electronic voting, blockchain and artificial intelligence, blockchain in supply chain, etc.
- Analyzed similar projects.
- Researched and explained the most widely used digital medical record standards.
- Researched and explained Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) standard.
