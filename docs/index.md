## Summary

I am a young computer scientist graduate in Havana University, Cuba. I graduated in November, 2020. Passionate about machine learning, blockchain technology, distributed systems and cryptography, I have read some interesting books: Distributed Systems written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Decentralized Applications written by Siraj Raval, Architecture for Blockchain Applications written by Xiwei Xu, Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques written by Ian H. Witten, and many papers in www.researchgate.net. My interest in distributed systems started when I implemented Chord DHT in a project, I was fascinated with the auto estabilize property of this data structure. I am a hard-working, inquisitive, creative and enthusiastic computer scientist with a strong theoretical background in distributed systems, machine learning, blockchain technology, programming and math. Skilled in collaboration, adaptability and communication. Experience of 1 year in blockchain and more than 4 years of experience in software development. I like to learn new languages and technologies related with machine learning, blockchain, distributed systems and cryptography.

## Work experience


April, 2021 ‚Äì present
Blockchain developer and researcher
Havana University, Havana, Cuba
        ‚ó¶ Researched the feasibility to apply Substrate blockchain framework to create a permissioned blockchain.
        ‚ó¶ Modified the substrate node template to get a permissioned blockchain node to create a permissioned blockchain.
        ‚ó¶ Docker images were created for the modified substrate nodes.
        ‚ó¶ Investigated the feasibility of using Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) to create smart contracts for a permissioned Substrate node blockchain.
        ‚ó¶ Currently working on a project to create a permissioned blockchain network using a modified Substrate node for issuing certificates. Certificates will be issued by educational institutions to students.
        ‚ó¶ Trained two computer science students in blockchain technology, teaching the theory behind blockchain, the most used blockchain platforms (Ethereum, Hyperledger Fabric, Substrate) and how to work with them.
