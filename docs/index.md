# Summary
:wave: Hi there, my name is Rainyel Ramos Gonz√°lez. I am a young computer scientist graduate in Havana University, Cuba. I graduated in November, 2020. Passionate about machine learning, blockchain technology, distributed systems and cryptography, I have read some interesting books: Distributed Systems written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Decentralized Applications written by Siraj Raval, Architecture for Blockchain Applications written by Xiwei Xu, Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques written by Ian H. Witten, and many papers in www.researchgate.net. My interest in distributed systems started when I implemented Chord DHT in a project, I was fascinated with the auto estabilize property of this data structure. I am a hard-working, inquisitive, creative and enthusiastic computer scientist with a strong theoretical background in distributed systems, machine learning, blockchain technology, programming and math. Skilled in collaboration, adaptability and communication. Experience of 1 year in blockchain and more than 4 years of experience in software development. I like to learn new languages and technologies related with machine learning, blockchain, distributed systems and cryptography.
