Cuban health care system work with physical health records, some efforts for digitalize health records has been realized but using centralized databases. In my undergraduate thesis project I implemented a functional prototype for electronic health record storage using Hyperledger Fabric. In this document are explained the details about this project. This system is a solution baseline for the electronic health record storage problem in Cuba. The final solution will be a national blockchain network with encrypted data for privacy.

- Researched the theory behind blockchain technology.
- Analyzed some blockchain platforms and technologies such as: Bitcoin, Ethereum, HashGraph, Hyperledger Fabric, BigChain, Corda, Quorum.
- Deeply analyzed the Hyperledger Fabric architecture.
- Explained the differences between private, permissioned and public blockchains.
- Different applications of blockchains were analyzed such as: blockchain in games, blockchain in electronic voting, blockchain and artificial intelligence, blockchain in supply chain, etc.
- Analyzed similar projects.
- Researched and explained the most widely used digital medical record standards.
- Researched and explained Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) standard.
- Create a organized code structure for the system.
- Proposed, designed and explained a smart contract for store medical records in OMOP format.
- Proposed, designed and explained a web application for intereact with the blockchain network.
- Proposed, designed and explained a blockchain network architecture for medical records storage using Hyperledger Fabric.
- Proposed a decentralized authentication method on Hyperledger Fabric.
- Proposed a hybrid encryption method for medical records encryption.
