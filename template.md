## Summary
I am a young computer scientist graduate in Havana University, Cuba. I graduated in November, 2020. Passionate about machine learning, blockchain technology, distributed systems and cryptography, I have read some interesting books: Distributed Systems written by Andrew S. Tanenbaum, Decentralized Applications written by Siraj Raval, Architecture for Blockchain Applications written by Xiwei Xu, Data mining: Practical machine learning tools and techniques written by Ian H. Witten, and many papers in www.researchgate.net. My interest in distributed systems started when I implemented Chord DHT in a project, I was fascinated with the auto estabilize property of this data structure. I am a hard-working, inquisitive, creative and enthusiastic computer scientist with a strong theoretical background in distributed systems, machine learning, blockchain technology, programming and math. Skilled in collaboration, adaptability and communication. Experience of 1 year in blockchain and more than 4 years of experience in software development. I like to learn new languages and technologies related with machine learning, blockchain, distributed systems and cryptography.

*September 2020* 

**[www.researchgate.net][9]**

Cuban health care system work with physical health records, some efforts for digitalize health records has been realized but using centralized databases. In this thesis document is proposed a functional prototype for electronic health record storage using Hyerledger Fabric. This system is a solution baseline for the electronic health record storage problem in Cuba. The final solution will be a national blockchain network with encrypted data for privacy.

- Researched the theory behind blockchain technology.
- Analyzed some blockchain platforms and technologies such as: Bitcoin, Ethereum, HashGraph, Hyperledger Fabric, BigChain, Corda, Quorum.
- Deeply analyzed the Hyperledger Fabric architecture.
- Explained the differences between private, permissioned and public blockchains.
- Different applications of blockchains were analyzed such as: blockchain in games, blockchain in electronic voting, blockchain and artificial intelligence, blockchain in supply chain, etc.
- Analyzed similar projects.
- Researched and explained the most widely used digital medical record standards.
- Researched and explained Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) standard.
- Create a organized code structure for the system.
- Proposed, designed and explained a smart contract for store medical records in OMOP format.
- Proposed, designed and explained a web application for intereact with the blockchain network.
- Proposed, designed and explained a blockchain network architecture for medical records storage using Hyperledger Fabric.
- Proposed a decentralized authentication method on Hyperledger Fabric.
